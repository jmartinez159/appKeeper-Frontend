# Welcome
This application is a web browser extension used to track if an applicant has applied to a specific job posting.
# Purpose
I have applied to many job postings in varies different job boards and company sites that I lose track of which specific job postings I have already applied to. There is also a problem with phishing emails and scammers posing as recruiters for fake companies offering jobs I had never applied to. This application will help mitigate interactions with malicious actors and save time on filling out job applications I have a already applied to.

# Application Keeper
This application is a web browser extension used to track what job applications user applied to and when.
# Purpose
I have applied to many job postings in varies different job boards and company sites that I lose track of which specific job postings I have already applied to. There is also a problem with phishing emails and scammers posing as recruiters for fake companies offering jobs I had never applied to. This application will help mitigate interactions with malicious actors and save time on filling out job applications I have a already applied to.
# Installing Web Extension For Edge
To use the extension, files need to be downloaded to the local machine. Go to Settings -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions and then enable "Developer Mode". Finally, select "Load unpacked" and select the folder in which the application is located in.
# How To Use
Application needs to be opened on the job posting page. Next, user needs to type in the name of the company into the textbox and click the 'Check' button. If the check comes back empty then, current job application has not been applied to by user. If user is going to continue with the application then, click the 'Apply' button(company name is REQUIRED) to record the application. Make sure the backend of Application Keeper is running!!!
